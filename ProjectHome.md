# jCocoa #

The main goal of creating this project is support of [ObjC2J](http://code.google.com/p/objc2j/) converter.

The reason of creating new project instead of using cool [rococoa](http://code.google.com/p/rococoa/) project, is it's license. We suggest Apache License 2.0, rococoa uses GPL.

Furthermore, we are going to create full UI port of Cocoa for Java, os-independent platform.

Our team needs donates for further development.
